    "AboutContent": "Keeway Bikes is a Hungarian motorcycle brand that produces and distributes motorcycles in India with the help of an Indian partner. Péter Kis, a former motorcycle racer, created the business in 1987 and gave it his mother's maiden name as the company's name. The RKS 150 and Blackstar cruiser, Keeway's first two products, were introduced in Hungary in the 1990s. Unfortunately, due to their subpar construction and design, neither model was successful in Europe. However, they continued with their production plans and developed additional new models, including the RY8 cafe racer and RX8 sports bike (both of which were launched in 2011).  "
